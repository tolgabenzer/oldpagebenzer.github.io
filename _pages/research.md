* #### Removing Cultural Barriers to Education: State-run Islamic Schools and Female Education in Turkey (Draft Available Upon Request)

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of access to state-run Islamic schools on female educational attainment, fertility, and labor market participation in Turkey. In contrast to traditional secular schools, Islamic schools offered a hybrid curriculum that also included religious instruction, a more conservative school environment, and a more tolerant attitude towards the use of headscarves. Islamic schools expanded rapidly in the mid-1970s, and girl students achieved the legal right to attend these schools after the 1976 Council of State ruling. Exploiting the variation in exposure to Islamic schools across cohorts and district centers, I find that girls exposed to Islamic schools were more likely to complete lower and upper secondary school, while the corresponding effects for boys were small and insignificant. Moreover, affected female cohorts had lower fertility and higher labor force participation during early adulthood. My results suggest that making secular institutions inclusive towards religious conservatives by eliminating cultural barriers to education managed to keep religious women in schooling and integrate them into public life.

* #### Islamic Schools and Political Islam

Abstract: This paper studies the impact of access to state-run Islamic schools during the 1970s on electoral outcomes in Turkey. I exploit the variation in the availability of Islamic schools across district centers and election years. I find that district centers with an Islamic school voted significantly more for Islamist parties after exposure to Islamic schools. The effect appears after prolonged exposure to Islamic schools and affected student cohorts came voting age. I also provide evidence that the Islamic brotherhoods, geographic sorting, or economic liberalization were not driving the differential increase in the support for Islamist parties. My findings indicate that policymakers identified with religious affiliations can utilize religious schooling as promotion centers of religious politics to achieve electoral success.
