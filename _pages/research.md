## Working Paper:

* ### <a href="https://tolgabenzer.github.io/files/benzer_jmp.pdf" target="_blank">Removing Cultural Barriers to Education: State-run Islamic Schools and Girls' Education in Turkey</a> (Job Market Paper)

<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the impact of access to state-run modern Islamic schools on girls' educational attainment, fertility, and labor market participation in Turkey. In contrast to secular schools, Islamic schools in Turkey offered a hybrid curriculum that also included religious instruction, a more conservative school environment, and a more tolerant attitude toward the use of headscarves. Islamic schools expanded rapidly in the mid-1970s, and girl students achieved the legal right to attend these schools after a 1976 Council of State ruling. Exploiting the variation in exposure to Islamic schools across district centers and cohorts, I find that girls exposed to Islamic schools were more likely to complete lower and upper secondary school, while the corresponding effects for boys were small and nonsignificant. Moreover, affected girl cohorts had lower fertility and higher labor force participation during early adulthood. My results suggest that making secular institutions inclusive toward religious conservatives by eliminating cultural barriers to education helped keep girls from religious families in school and integrate them into public life. 

* ### <a href="https://tolgabenzer.github.io/files/benzer_paper_elections.pdf" target="_blank">Islamic Schools and Political Islam</a>

<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the impact of access to state-run Islamic schools during the 1970s on electoral outcomes in Turkey. I exploit the variation in the availability of Islamic schools across district centers and election years. I find that district centers with an Islamic school voted significantly more for Islamist parties after exposure to Islamic schools. The effect appears after prolonged exposure to Islamic schools and affected student cohorts came voting age. I also provide evidence that the Islamic brotherhoods, geographic sorting, or economic liberalization were not driving the differential increase in the support for Islamist parties. My findings indicate that policymakers identified with religious affiliations can utilize religious schooling as promotion centers of religious politics to achieve electoral success.

## Work in Progress:

* ### Christian Missions and Political Islam

<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the long-term impact of Christian missions in colonial Egypt on present-day electoral outcomes. I combine contemporary census and election data at the district level with historical information on the spatial distribution of Christian missionaries and Muslim Brotherhood branches in early twentieth-century Egypt. I document a robust negative association between proximity to historical Christian missions and the support for Muslim Brotherhood in the 2012 Egyptian presidential elections. I do not find any relationship between Christian missions and historical Muslim Brotherhood presence. Finally, I present evidence that missionsâ€™ lasting effect is partly explained by increased human capital and local economic development, indicating the existence of education cleavage as an important determinant for the support for Islamist parties.
