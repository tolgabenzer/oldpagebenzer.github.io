<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the impact of access to state-run modern Islamic schools on girlsâ€™ educational attainment, fertility, and labor market participation in Turkey. In contrast to secular schools, Islamic schools in Turkey offered a hybrid curriculum that also included religious instruction, a more conservative school environment, and a more tolerant attitude toward the use of headscarves. Islamic schools expanded rapidly in the mid-1970s, and girl students achieved the legal right to attend these schools after a ruling by the secular highest administrative court in 1976. Exploiting the variation in exposure to Islamic schools across districts and cohorts, I find that girls exposed to Islamic schools were more likely to complete lower and upper secondary school, while the corresponding effects for boys were small and nonsignificant. Moreover, affected women had lower fertility and higher labor force participation during early adulthood. My results suggest that making educational institutions inclusive toward culturally excluded groups by eliminating cultural barriers to education help to keep these groups in school and integrate them into public life.

<ins>Abstract:</ins> This paper studies the impact of the establishment of state-run modern Islamic schools during the 1970s on electoral outcomes in Turkey. Exploiting the variation in exposure to Islamic schools across district centers and election years, I find that district centers with an Islamic school voted
significantly more for Islamist parties after exposure to Islamic schools. The effect appears after prolonged exposure to Islamic schools, once affected student cohorts came of voting age. Last, I provide evidence that increased organizational capacity, male political activism, and ideological change were influential mechanisms driving the effect.
