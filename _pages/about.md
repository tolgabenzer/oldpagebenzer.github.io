I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [Aalto University School of Business](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi).

My research interests lie at the intersection of labor, development and political economics with a focus on culture and education. I am also interested in economic history.

Please find my curriculum vitae [here](https://tolgabenzer.github.io/files/benzer_cv.pdf) and my research [here](https://tolgabenzer.com/research/).
