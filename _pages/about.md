I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the [Aalto University School of Business](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi).

My research interests lie at the intersection of development economics and political economy with a focus on economics of culture and religion. I am also interested in economic history.

I am on the 2021/2022 academic job market and will be available for interviews at EJME 2021 in December or on demand.

Please find my curriculum vitae [here](https://tolgabenzer.github.io/files/benzer_cv.pdf) and my job market paper [here](https://tolgabenzer.github.io/files/benzer_jmp.pdf).
