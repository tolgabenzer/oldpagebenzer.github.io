I am a Senior Researcher at the [INVESThub](https://www.utu.fi/en/investhub) of University of Turku and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Turku School of Economics](https://www.utu.fi/en/university/turku-school-of-economics/economics). I received my PhD in Economics from Aalto University School of Business in 2022.

My research interests lie at the intersection of development and political economics with a focus on culture and education. I am also interested in economic history.

Please find my curriculum vitae [here](https://tolgabenzer.github.io/files/benzer_cv.pdf) and my research [here](https://tolgabenzer.com/research/).
